-- CHAPTER 1 --
I find myself alone on a strange world, unequipped and in danger. I have no memory of how I got here, no sense of a before.
My Exosuit at least seems to know what it's doing, and I am not dead yet...
-- CHAPTER 2 --
I received a set of mysterious coordinates from an unknown source.
I followed the signal, and found the wreckage of an abandoned starship.
There was little to be gained from the wreck, but the distress beacon contained the hailing frequency labelled 'ARTEMIS'.
